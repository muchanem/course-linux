# Ubuntu Linux and Shell Scripting

*CURRENTLY WORK IN PROGRESS*

Welcome to Linux, the best free operating system on the planet! Linux
powers most of the world's web servers and network routers these days.
You would be surprised where you might find it, including traffic
lights, toys, even your phone. Because of how incredibly small Linux
can be it fits on almost anything and can be stripped down to do only
what it needs to do well. Ubuntu Linux has also become a powerful and
stable desktop operating system supported by most major software
producers including even Value. This course introduces you to Ubuntu
Linux as a desktop and a server and adds command-line wizard powers
brought by the shell.
