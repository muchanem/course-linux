## To Instructors

**Time and Scheduling:** Most of the material in this course is
designed to be done in class, in person. Therefore, it will take
probably more than 16 weeks of 90 minutes per week. It really depends
on the students. Generally this means there is material here for two
semesters.

**Age:** 12 and up

**Resources and Requirements:** Ideally every student in this course
should have a new Digital Ocean Ubuntu server instance (or the
equivalent) and an individual laptop on which to install Ubuntu
from scratch.

**GitHub Classroom:** This course is setup to work well with
classroom.github.com` and we encourage it. Because everything in
this repo is released to the public domain you should have no problem
setting up an "assignment" as follows for use with your own students.

Using GitHub classroom with private repos allows students to work
without the worry of being scrutinized by peers and the public.

**Follow Up Possibilities:** Any Linux certification courses could
easily follow this course, which nearly covers all the LPIC-0
requirements.
